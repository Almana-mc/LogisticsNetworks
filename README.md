Have you ever wanted a fully wireless, efficient and yet fast logistical system? Well then this mod is for you. There are no real blocks either, all you do is stick a node on the block you wish to transport from and to and then it works!!

## Features

The mod is completely wireless. Along with that it can be totally **hidden**. There is no real block and hence the automation can be suspended in air if you want. The mod's current capabilities:

1. Transfer items, fluids, FE and Mekanism's chemicals.
2. All nodes have redstone control.
3. 1 node has 9 channels so 9 different processes can run at once.
4. You can select any side for input or output operations.
5. Transfer upto 10k items, 1000b of fluid, 2.1b fe/t or 1000b of chemicals __per channel__ with nearly no lag.
6. Allows cross dimensional transfer with a special upgrade.

## Vision

This mod is what I wanted in modded minecraft for a while. Its fast, highly configurable, lag friendly and also is completely invisible if you want it to be.

Currently, it can transport items, fluids and energy. In future, I plan to add support for several resources of different mods. Along with this, I will work on adding special compat to allow better suitability for certain larger builds.

## Pack Developers

This mod offers certain tags to allow more control over what can transferred and what blocks can nodes connect to. Following are the tags:
1. `logisticsnetwork:blacklist/block`: This tag allows you to blacklist any blocks on which the nodes can be placed.
2. `logisticsnetwork:blacklist/item`: This tag allows you to blacklist particular items from being transferred.
3. `logisticsnetwork:blacklist/fluid`: This tag allows you to blacklist particular fluids from being transferred.
4. `logisticsnetwork:blacklist/chemical`: This tag allows you to blacklist particular chemicals from being transferred.

## Development

As a solo developer, updates may take time sometimes. I wish you will be patient with me and my work. For any questions regarding ports, I have no particular plans for backports yet. If there is a higher demand, I may backport to 1.20 or at most 1.19.
