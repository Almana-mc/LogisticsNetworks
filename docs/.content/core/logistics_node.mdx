# Logistics Node

The Logistics Node is the main block you'll use to build your network. It connects any inventory—like a Chest or Furnace—to the rest of your system.
Nodes are not real blocks, they are entities that attach to the blocks.

## How it works

When you place a node against a block, it "attaches" to it. This lets the node see what's inside that block and move items in or out based on how you set it up.

### Key Features

- **9 Channels:** Each node has 9 separate channels. You can use these to organize different tasks or resources without them mixing up.
- **4 Upgrade Slots:** You can make nodes faster or smarter by adding upgrades like the [](@logisticsnetworks:iron_upgrade). Just pop them into the upgrade slots.
- **Smart Config:** You can filter exactly what items are allowed in or out for each channel.

## Setting it up

1.  **Place the Node:** Shift Right-click on the side of an inventory block. The node will stick to it.
2.  **Open the GUI:** Grab your [](@logisticsnetworks:wrench) and right-click the node to open its menu.
3.  **Configure:** Pick a channel, set your filters, and you're good to go.

That's pretty much it. It's the bridge between your storage and your network.
