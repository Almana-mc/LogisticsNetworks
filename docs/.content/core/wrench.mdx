# Wrench

The Wrench is your main tool for managing Logistics Networks. You'll need it to set up nodes and take them down.

<PrefabObtaining />

## What it does

It has two main jobs: configuring nodes and removing them.

### Configuring Nodes

To change settings on a [](@logisticsnetworks:logistics_node), just hold the Wrench and **Right-Click** on the node. This opens the interface where you can:

- Change channel settings (extract, insert, etc.)
- Add or remove upgrades
- Set up item filters

### Removing Nodes

If you need to move a node or get rid of it, hold **Shift** and **Right-Click** it with the Wrench.

- It instantly breaks the node.
- The node item drops on the ground.
- Any upgrades inside the node drop with it, so you don't lose anything.

It's a lot safer than breaking the block behind it!
