# How to help

Here is how it works.
You can read the code.
You can fix things.

### Find a bug

Use the issue page.
But here is the problem.
We need the exact steps.
Tell us what to click.

### Write some code

Make a fork of the project.
Add your new code.
This can help you learn.
Send a pull request.
Tell us about the fix.
And why it matters or what it fixes.

### Code rules

Keep the words simple.
Make it easy to read.
Do not use AI.
Test your work.
